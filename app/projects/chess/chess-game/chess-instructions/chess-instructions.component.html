    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    The goal of chess is to capture the enemy king. Once that is done, the game will end and the winner declared.
    The game will also end if a player doesn't have any legal moves left.
    <br>A player captures an enemy piece by moving their piece to their tile. Captured pieces are removed from the game.
    Each player does always one move each turn. Skipping isn't possible. White player always starts the game.
    <br><h1>Pieces</h1>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-pawn.png"></td>
        <td><b>Pawns</b> are the most common piece. Pawns can move 1 square forward if it isn't occupied by another piece. 
        On the first move they can alternatively move 2 squares.
        <br>Pawns can normally only capture pieces that are on diagonal squares in front of them.
        <br>If an enemy pawn moves next to pawn (horizontally) by moving 2 squares, pawn can capture it with en passant special move.
        In en passant pawn moves diagonally behind the enemy pawn and captures it.
        <br>Once a pawn reaches other end of the board, it is automatically promoted to queen.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-knight.png"></td>
        <td><b>Knights</b> can move to any of the closest squares that aren't horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 
        <br>Their moves form L shape: 2 forward, 1 left/right. Knights can jump over other pieces.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-rook.png"></td>
        <td><b>Rooks</b> can move horizontally and vertically to any direction any number of squares, but can't jump over other pieces.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-bishop.png"></td>
        <td><b>Bishops</b> can move diagonally to any direction any number of squares, but can't jump over other pieces.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-queen.png"></td>
        <td><b>Queens</b> have same moves as rooks and bishops (all horizontal, vertical and diagonal squares).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/chess/white-king.png"></td>
        <td><b>King</b> is the most valuable piece - once the king is captured, the game ends.
        <br>King can move one square to any direction.
        <br>King also has a special move, castling, which moves king 2 steps towards a rook and moves rook behind the king. This has following conditions:
        <br>1. King and rook must have not moved during the game (and must be on same row).
        <br>2. There can't be any pieces between the king and the rook.
        <br>3. The king must not be in check, and king must not pass through a tile that could be attacked by enemy player in their next turn.
