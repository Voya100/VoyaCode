Hi!

This is a repository for my website, www.voyacode.com. 

This repository contains most of the site files, not including admin files. Repository also has many of my projects, 
which are on my website.

At the time of writing this (14.12.2016) Voya Code still has much that could be improved. My older projects (Rock, Paper, 
Scissors and Slay the Dragon) are also badly outdated. I have plans to make improvements to them some time in the future, but
I'm not sure when.

If you have any improvement suggestions (or suggestions for future coding projects), feel free to suggest. :)
