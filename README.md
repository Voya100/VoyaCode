Hi!

This is a repository for my website, www.voyacode.com, which I use for my personal projects. The website is implemented with Angular 2, and it uses AOT (Ahead-of-time) compilation. Styling is done with Sass (scss).

Actual Angular code can be found from app/ directory. Website uses lazy loading, so each web page has their own module, which are in their own directories. All of my projects can be found in app/projects/ directory.

This repository is missing some of the files, such as admin and server side (PHP) files, to prevent potential security issues.

If you have any improvement suggestions (or suggestions for future coding projects), feel free to suggest. :)
