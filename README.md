# Voya Code

This is a repository for my website, https://voyacode.com, which I use for my personal projects. The website is implemented with Angular, and it uses AOT (Ahead-of-time) compilation. Styling is done with Sass (scss).

Actual Angular code can be found from [app/](https://github.com/Voya100/VoyaCode/tree/master/app) directory. Website uses lazy loading, so each web page has their own module, which are in their own directories. All of my projects can be found in [app/projects/](https://github.com/Voya100/VoyaCode/tree/master/app/projects) directory.

[public/](https://github.com/Voya100/VoyaCode/tree/master/public) directory contains the actual website that is seen by the users. It includes some static assets (such as images) and the minified app build that webpack produces.

This repository doesn't include files used by the nodejs backend.

If you have any improvement suggestions (or suggestions for future coding projects), feel free to suggest. :)
